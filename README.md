# Jenkins Bot built with CTO.ai

[WIP] - This is a very primitive initial release of the bot
This bot is a CLI to your Jenkins which allows you to perform some common operations like:

-   Create Jobs
-   View Status of a Build
-   Trigger Builds

In order to run this bot, you must specify the following details in your local environment:

-   JENKINS_USERNAME
-   JENKINS_PASSWORD
-   JENKINS_DOMAIN

Domain here refers to the jenkins url.
